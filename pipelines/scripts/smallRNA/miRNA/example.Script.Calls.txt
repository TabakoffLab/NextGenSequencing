##Create a list of features merged based overlapping genome coordinates

mergeMiRNA.py /path/fileList.txt /path/outputPrefix


##Create a fasta with coordinates and strand fom the merged features
##Note if a feature is on the -1 strand the output sequence has been reverse complimented and is the sense strand for the feature.
