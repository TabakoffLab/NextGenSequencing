RI Panel - Batch 1 (Brain) Total RNA RNA-Seq
========================================================

* 2 samples per strain (SHR, BXH12, HXB13, HXB17, HXB2, HXB25, HXB27, HXB7)
* ribosomal RNA depleted total RNA
* 2X100 reads using the stranded protocol
* sequencing done by Beckman Coulter Genomics - received September 5, 2014
* synthetic spike-in were added to each sample 
  * SHR_1, BXH12_1, HXB13_1, HXB17_1, HXB2_1, HXB25_1, HXB27_1, and HXB7_1 have mix 1; SHR_2, BXH12_2, HXB13_2, HXB17_2, HXB2_2, HXB25_2, HXB27_2, and HXB7_2 have mix 2
  * ? mL of 1:100 diluted spikes were add after RNA extraction but before rRNA-depletion
  * Information regarding the spike-ins can be found here: http://products.invitrogen.com/ivgn/product/4456739
